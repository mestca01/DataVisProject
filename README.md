# What is the Secret to Getting the Second Date?
***What influences love at first sight? (Or, at least, love in the first four minutes?)***

### Introduction

* Data was gathered from 552 participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004.

 * This experiment was created by Columbia Business School professors Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar for their paper Gender Differences in Mate Selection: Evidence From a Speed Dating Experiment.

* During the events, the attendees would have a four minute "first date" with every other participant of the opposite sex.

* At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes:
    * **Attractiveness
    * Sincerity
    * Intelligence
    * Fun
    * Ambition
    * Shared Interests
    
* The dataset also includes questionnaire data gathered from participants at different points in the process. These fields include:
    * Demographics
    * Self-Perception Across Key Attributes
    * Beliefs on What Others Find Valuable in a Mate
    * Lifestyle Information
